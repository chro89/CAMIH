# CAMIH - Complementary and Alternative Medicine Insights Hub

This repository is part of the publication "CAMIH - Complementary and Alternative Medicine Insights Hub", which is currently under review at AIME 2025.

It contains the following information:

- All_properties.png is a visualization of the ontology we used to represent evidence in CAMIH.
- properties_and_values.txt contains all properties and their allowed values in our database. If a property does not have an allowed value, users can enter any alphanumeric information.
- Templates: this directory contains all semantic templates ([Link](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Semantic_templates)) we created to represent information in CAMIH.
- Forms: this directory contains all input forms ([Link](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Page_Forms)) we created that help users create content in CAMIH.
