- ''Results during intervention'' means that the time of data collection is during or shortly after the period of the intervention (e.g. on the last day or a few days after). The results therefore still relate to the direct effects of the intervention.
- ''Results after intervention'' means there is a longer break between the time of data collection and the end of the intervention, e.g. more than a week. The results relate more to long-term effects.
- If a categorization in ''Results during vs. after intervention'' is not possible (e.g. survival data), the results are summarized under ''Results after intervention'' under the headline "Overall".|note}}
